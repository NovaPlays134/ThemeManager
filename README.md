# ThemeManager
A quick theme picker for Stand mod menu
if you want to switch themes its the best to first apply the default theme and then the new one you want to have
because of the headers not loading :D

# How to install
copy resources folder and ThemeManager file and paste them in Lua Scripts folder
then copy the Profiles folder and paste it in Stand folder
and load the new profile in stand.

# suggestions
if you have any cool themes you can send them in my discord or to me with dms
